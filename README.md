## Description:
This application was used to create an interactive fitness tracker. This website allows you to track items such as excercises performed, total weight lifted, total sets performed, teotal reps performed, total distance (Miles), date, and workout duration. When you start a new workout you will select the 'New Workout'. That will take you to the beginning of your workout where you can choose your excercise type. The options are resistance (weights) or cardio. Once you complete your workout you can utilize the 'Dashboard' in the top left of the page to track your historical performance.

## User Story:

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Acceptance Criteria:

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
